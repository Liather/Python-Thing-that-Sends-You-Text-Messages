# Python-Thing-that-Sends-You-Text-Messages

This project is run by Twilio, a python library, used to send text messages. I have used Twilio to send myself insults through out the day. I have used the website http://www.robietherobot.com/insult-generator.htm to come up with the insults. I intend on automaticaly take insults from this website rather than having a list.
